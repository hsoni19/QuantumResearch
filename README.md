Quantum Key Distribution and Post Quantum Cryptography

Brief Outline

• I started with researching the topic quantum key distribution and trying to
understand what it was and what quantum phenomena it relies on. I continued
to look the different protocol’s proposed

• Once I had grasped the physics behind it, I moved on to researching the tool
Qiskit and how I could use it to simulate the process involved in one of the
protocols. Here, I chose BB84 and used Jupyter Notebook (photos below) to
layout my notes and code, displaying the encoding of bits into qubits and the
sifting and sampling processes to produce matching keys. I encountered a few
problems with outdated the library’s functions and needed to do some further
research into the version discrepancies to determine which functions and
modules had been replaced.

• Next, I focused on post quantum cryptography algorithms, looking into NIST’s
proposed protocols as well as the different types of PQC algorithms available. I
explored the lattice algorithms in greater depth as they seemed particularly
relevant, and the mathematical concept of vector lattices were new to me and
very fascinating.

• After completing a significant part of my research, I wrote an essay to
consolidate my knowledge. I also added some details about the uses and threats
of quantum computing overall. (essay below)

• Finally, I wanted to create a visual tool to aid my explanation. I approached the
task by researching different animation-making techniques. I was initially drawn
to using TypeScript based forms, eg with Motion Canva but I was met with some
issues when trying to download and use it. Therefore, I moved to drawing the
animation frame by frame and was able to create a video explaining BB84.
